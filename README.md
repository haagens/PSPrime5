PSPrime5
========

PSPrime5 is going to be a 100% hypothetical emulator that seeks to emulate an imaginary Playstation 5 before it has even been conceived. Since the specs and hardware are unknown, all of the work is "hypothetical"; an educated guess. Assuming virtual-reality gaming is near, it's possible that PSPrime5 can support that, as well as being optimized for supercomputers, utilize 3-D 4k graphics, and maybe wireless gear. Since there's no preconceived notion of what games it can play (since none exist; neither does the hypothetical console project here), homebrews are the only option.
